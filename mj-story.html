    <h1>MJ's Story!</h1>
    <h2>Birth and Younghood</h2>

    <p>My pet'is a male dog, with a name as Major, and in short, "MJ." He was born on May 2018 in Kitengela and was brought
       up in the same surrounding. His name, "Major" reflects the nature of the change that his coming into my life brought:
       A Major change!
    </p>
    <p>Among his favorite activities include the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Walking in the morning and evenings at the following times:
        <ol>
          <li>0900 hrs - 1000 hrs</li>
          <li>1700 hrs - 1800 hrs</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Playing in the house</li>
      <li>Playing with his toy</li>
      <li>Chewing my shoes! (Really)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>He is forever a friend, and would never imagine my life without him. He makes most of my days and I hope I do make his days too in return!</p>
